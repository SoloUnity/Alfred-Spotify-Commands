Locally run Spotify media controls through global commands. Avoid the need to rely on external servers! Plus discord bot inspired keywords in case you forget your commands.

# How to run/install it?
Check releases tab, download the workflow and double click it to add it to alfred.
Alfred powerpack is of course required.

# How does this work?
The workflow uses applescript to interface with Spotify, bypassing the need to use the Spotify API. Works without internet!

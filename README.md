Spotify Commands
</h1>

Locally run Spotify media controls through global commands. Avoid the need to rely on external servers! Plus discord bot inspired keywords in case you forget your commands.

# How to run/install it?
Check releases tab, download the workflow and double click it to add it to alfred.
Alfred powerpack is of course required.

# How does this work?
The workflow uses applescript and python to interface with Spotify and macOS, bypassing the need to use the Spotify API and talk to Spotify servers. This means that it works offline and without delay!

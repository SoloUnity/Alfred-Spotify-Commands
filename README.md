# How do I install it?
1) Check [releases](https://github.com/SoloUnity/alfred-Spotify-Commands/releases)
2) Download the latest version of the workflow
3) Double click the downloaded workflow file and import it into alfred
4) Customize by setting up your own commands

# How does this work?
The workflow uses both python and applescript to interface with Spotify and macOS, bypassing the need to use the Spotify API and talk to Spotify servers. This means that it works offline and without delay!
